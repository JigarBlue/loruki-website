Instead of adding a new element to an html, 
we'll use before and after sudo selector classes 
or sudo selectors in css.
And when you use these ensure to add 'contain' with an eempty value.

We can create utility classes for text and margins
like my-1 for margin top and bottom coz y is for y-axis which is vertical,
if we want to do left and right then mx-1 or if we want to do margin all around,
then we can do m-1. So we can create these utilities to help us out, 
so we dont have to add too much css, and so much margin padding on like h3 itself.
like:  <h3 class="stats-heading text-center my-1">

div*3 in html for 3 div elemts
mac: shift + option + down key to copy paste the items


we have used my-1 and m1 plus py-1 and p1 for utilties
instead of adding styles for idividual elements

Use grid and flexbox intead of using floats and tables in css. Its much easier.
